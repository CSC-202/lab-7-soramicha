    The shorter the messages/lyrics are, the more the words are compressed. For example, the song Cups had a lot shorter lyrics than light switch, which had the longest lyrics. But in the graph, Cups had a higher compression rate than Light Switch and Birthday. For the mantras, the third mantra was also the shortest. The frequencies of each letter in each song was similar because ratio-wise it was similar and all close to 0 percent, even though the themes of each song I used were quite different. For example, the frequencies of each song in my messages for say the letter A was 18/2333 (Light Switch), 5/1972 (Birthday), and 8/1216 (Cups). For mantras though, it was 9/118, 1/52, and 4/85, which was a slightly higher frequency. I also realize that the frequenceis of each letter in the messages are always close to 0 percent. The unqiue vocabulary words in certain songs would be the repetetive words that would often come up in the songs. For example, the song light switch would have the unique word of 'light switch' appear more often. In terms of compression, all the songs and mantras seemed to finish compressing at 56%, and no matter how long the song or mantra is afterwards, it would still have the compression rate of 56%, making it pretty consistent. Overall, the compression performance from Huffman is pretty good because knowing how more common letters used are represented by smaller bits makes the entire compression a lot smaller than the original. It saves a lot more memory and cuts nearly half the original space it took to store the lyrics and mantras.

    The length of the messages don't impact the huffman tree much in height, but it would depending on the specific occurences of each letter involved (frequencies). The height of the tree with more frequencies may grow bigger compared to a tree with not many letters involved. The shorter the huffman tree, the more the compression ratio it will have, vice versa. The imbalance will increase due to the size of the tree and searching-wise it will be a lot more slow and complicated due to the many letters involved in the songs. For mantras, since they are a lot shorter than songs, there is a higher chance not all letters in the alphabet are used and therefore may have a smaller huffman tree with a bigger chance of it being more balanced.
